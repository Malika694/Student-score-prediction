# 🎓 Student Score Prediction

This project predicts **student exam scores** using **Linear Regression** based on their performance dataset.  
It is part of a Machine Learning internship task.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Build a regression model to predict student scores.
- **Dataset:** [StudentsPerformance.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, R² Score

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset contains students' scores in:
- **Math**
- **Reading**
- **Writing**  
Along with demographic and other features.

## ⚙️ Installation & Requirements
To run this notebook, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Student-Score-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Student-Score-Prediction
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TASK_1_Student_Score_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of student scores
- Correlation heatmap between scores
- Basic statistics & missing value check

---

## 🤖 Model Building
- Split dataset into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)**
- Applied **Linear Regression**
- Evaluated using:
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R² Score**

---

## 📈 Results
- The model gives a good prediction of student scores based on input features.
- Performance metrics are displayed in the notebook.
